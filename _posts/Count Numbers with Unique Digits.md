Given a non-negative integer n, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 ≤ x < 10n.
Example:
Given n = 2, return 91. (The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 ≤ x < 100, excluding [11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99])

Hint:

	A direct way is to use the backtracking approach.
	Backtracking should contains three states which are (the current number, number of steps to get that number and a bitmask which represent which number is marked as visited so far in the current number). Start with state (0,0,0) and count all valid number till we reach number of steps equals to 10n.
	This problem can also be solved using a dynamic programming approach and some knowledge of combinatorics.
	Let f(k) = count of numbers with unique digits with length equals k.
	f(1) = 10, ..., f(k) = 9 * 9 * 8 * ... (9 - k + 2) [The first factor is 9 because a number cannot start with 0].
**思路：**
This is a digit combination problem. Can be solved in at most 10 loops.

When n == 0, return 1. I got this answer from the test case.

When n == 1, _ can put 10 digit in the only position. [0, ... , 10]. Answer is 10.

When n == 2, _ _ first digit has 9 choices [1, ..., 9], second one has 9 choices excluding the already chosen one. So totally 9 * 9 = 81. answer should be 10 + 81 = 91

When n == 3, _ _ _ total choice is 9 * 9 * 8 = 684. answer is 10 + 81 + 648 = 739

When n == 4, _ _ _ _ total choice is 9 * 9 * 8 * 7.

...

When n == 10, _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ total choice is 9 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

When n == 11, _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ total choice is 9 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 0 = 0
``` java
public class Solution {
    public int countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(int n) {
        if(n == 0) 
            return 1;
            
        int ans = 10, base = 9;
        
        for(int i=2;i<=n&&i<=10;i++){
            base = base * (11-i);
            ans += base;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
